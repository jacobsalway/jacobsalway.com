Welcome! This is the first blog post on my website. I'm a newly minted data engineer and have worked as a data analyst for the past two years during my study and as a graduate. In my data analyst role, I started as more of a traditional data analyst doing analysis and visualisation with SQL, Python and Tableau, but after I moved teams internally, I became more of a data analyst/engineer hybrid, working on data pipelines on Airflow with SQL and Spark and productionising a machine learning model on AWS.

On this blog, I plan to post about anything I come across during my work, side projects or self study that I think would be useful to anyone else in the data or software engineering fields. I hope you'll find what I post useful.

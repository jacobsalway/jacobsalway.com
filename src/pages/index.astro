        I'm a software engineer based in Sydney, Australia. I currently work on
        the platform/data infrastructure team at Rokt, primarily working with
        Kubernetes, Spark, Kafka, and AWS. I've previously worked as a data
        engineer and data analyst, and I do some full-stack web development on
        the side.
